//what is stream
-to process the object or data store in collection is called stream.
-present in java.util package.
-Stream is just an interface
-it is not compulsory that stream is only used for collection.stream can be use for any group of element,array.

//stream provides following mechanisms.
1.filter()     (to filter data acc to condition)
2.map()        (to add something in collection data or do additional process on collection data and do mapping of that data)
3.sorted()     (to sort data which is stored in stream)
4.count()      (to count how many data present in stream)
5.collect()    (after filter whatever data we will get to collect that and store in another collection we use collect())
6.distinct()   (to get unique data)
7.foreach()    (to read each and every value from collection)
8.min()        (to find minimum value)
9.max()        (to find maximum value)
10.limit()     (to get top elements as per user)
11.flatmap()   (to work with complex collection.map will return single value bt flatmap will return multiple values.it wil return stream of object)
12.reduce()    (to combine all object into one single object.EX: A,B,C . o/p: ABC)
13.toArray()   (to convert stream object to array)
14.anyMatch()  (it will return true of any of user input is matches with given any collection object)
15.allMatch()  (it will give boolean value true or false)
16.noneMatch() (if user input is not match with given list it will print true else print false)
17.findAny()   (it will give any random element from given stream)
18.findFirst() (to return first element from stream)
19.Comparator.reverseOrder() (to reverse the list)
20.Stream.concat(stream1,stream2) (to merge two streams)
21.Stream.of() (to create stream)

//2nd way of creating stream
Stream<String> newStr= Stream.of(str);
    ->dataType<-           ->collection name<-


with the help of this we can process data from collection.
-while proceesing in collection first we store collection data in stream then we apply stream methods
and then we store that desire output in some another collection.

-we pass the predicates in stream method
ex:l.stream().filter(x->x*2).collect.......
here, x->x*2 is the predicate.
-predicate means boolean valued function

//another way to add elements in list:-
-1st way:- List<Integer> numbers= Arrays.asList(10,15,20,25,30);
-2nd way:- List<Integer> l1= List.of(2,5,9,10,12);   //this way is immutable i.e. once we create a list with this method we cant make any chaanges.

//Parellel stream
-to improve performance 
-excecution will be faster
-stream will divide into multiple sub stream

//stream API and IO stream are different.
-IO stream are sequence of data.
-with the help of IO stream we read and write data from source to destiny.

//Optional
-Optional is used to represent a value that may or may not be present.
