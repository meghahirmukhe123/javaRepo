//Package
-group of class.

//static
- Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.

//variable
-to store value.

//abs in mathematical operator
-abs() method returns the absolute (positive) value of a number.
ex:
sout(Math.abs(-12));
o/p= 12

//to find random number between two no's
ex: between 4 and 8
-sout(4+(8-4)*Math.random());

//OOP's
-class is not a real world entity.it is blueprint.
-object is set of code which perform perticular task.it is an instance of class.it is real world entity.it occupies memory.

//what is functional interface
-interface having only one method.if more than one method is present in interface then that will not be functional interface
-lamda function follows the functional interface



//to reverse string of collection
- StringBuffer b= new StringBuffer(name-of-collecion);
sout(b.reverse);  ///it will reverse each word or element of collection

//Lamda:-
-It is used with functional interface i.e.only one abstract class should be there.
-we cant create obj of interface
-Only abstract methods are present in functional interface. i.e. interface is collection of abstract class.
-@FunctionalInterface = this annotation shows only one abstract method should be there.

#3 functional interfaces
1.Runnable has run() abstract method;
2.Collable has call() abstract method;
3.Comparable has comapareTo() method.
4.ActionListener has actionperformed() method.

//Predefined functional interfaces(if we dont have functional interface in our coding bt still want to use lamda then use this).

1.Predicate =>test()
-When we have to check conditons i.e. if else that time prefer this.
-predicate has test() method which take one parameter.
-test() takes one parameter takes.gives boolean answer.
-to join two or more predicate we use "and","or","negate(same as NOT operator)".

2.Function =>apply()
-when we want to give some input and want to get output as value not a boolean answer then prefer this.
-In fuction interface we have apply() method.
-apply() takes any parameter and returs single value of any type.
-Syntax:
Function<type, return_type>
{
  return apply(type);
}
-to combine function a]andThen() b]compose()...reverse order of andThen() function

3.Consumer =>accept()
-it has single abstract method i.e. accept().
-It will take one input as parameter and does not return anything.It just do action.


4.Supplier =>get()
-it has single abstract method i.e. get().
-It will not take parameter but return some object or value.

**above all predefine functional interface are present in java.util.function package
Predicate<String> p=e-> e.length();
p=refernce variable
e=argument variable

//Exception handling
- when exception occures methoc creates exception object which contain 1.Exception name 2.Description 3.Stack trace(means in which line exception is occured)
and passed to JVM.

//e.printStackTrace()
-It is a method of Java's throwable class which prints the throwable along with other details like the line number and class name where the exception occurred. 
-throw() keyword 
  =>throws user define exception object to JVM.
  =>it is used with user define exception or custome exception(those exception which we create)
-Checked(Compile time exception).
-Unchecked(Runtime exception)
